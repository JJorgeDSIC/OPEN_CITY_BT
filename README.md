# Open City (Bachelor Thesis 13/07/2015)

### Abstract

The current state of the industry of entertainment, requires generating contents of diverse kind, in order to offer new experiences to the player and surprise the spectator with new approaches. Regarding the contents, one of the major challenges for the interactive graphics systems is the generation of scenarios where action occurs. 

These scenarios, specifically the urban ones, contemplate wide difficulties and a huge complexity. Thus, since decades, one important case of study is shaping and set up the road distribution or reflect the size or which shape will have the buildings in an automatic way. 

For that reason, a theoretical and practical framework to deal with this problem is proposed in this project. Thus, a library of generation of urban synthetic environment has been developed, allowing the interaction in 3D under the technology of the browser, all by means of WebGL and three.js.
